        <h3 id="story">Story:</h3>
          <p>I worked as a New Zealand Registered Dietitian for 2 years, first in the Food Service Industry and then in High Performance Sport. During my time as a Dietitian, I realised that nutrition doesnâ€™t change very much. What seemed to matter most were the relationships I built with individuals and the way I conveyed a message.</p>
          <p>I wanted to know how I could reach more people and work in a faster-paced, ever-changing field, where you collaborate on projects and are continually learning. To understand more about the world around me, I decided to travel around Europe for a few months, then work as as a teacher assistant in London. I have been using my spare time to explore the exciting world of coding!</p>
          <p>I love how coding provides a platform for sharing information across the globe in creative and captivating ways. I hope to bring my interpersonal and research skills from a previous profession, into running experiments which observe the impact a great digital experience has on customers.</p>
